Dear {{ mp.full_name }},

It's a difficult time for those of us in the labour movement. After 5 years of a coalition government which was catastrophic for working people and those who need the most help from society, Labour's defeat at the ballot box is doubly disappointing. In light of this, I believe we need to take the opportunity presented by the current leadership debate to conduct an open and honest debate about what our party stands for, and how we should best realise our shared goal of achieving a fairer, more just society.

The majority of the current leadership contenders share a consensus view that Labour must occupy the centre ground if we are to win the hearts and minds of the British electorate. I'm not sure this is the case. Our defeat to the anti-austerity SNP in Scotland shows that for a large proportion of the population, it was Labour's failure to make a convincing case against Tory austerity that lost us their vote.

In light of this, I believe it's especially important that a diverse range of candidates are presented to the party membership in the upcoming leadership ballot - in order to understand what went wrong, it's crucial that we listen to those we represent. As a result, I am urging you to nominate Jeremy Corbyn MP for the party leadership. Jeremy is a principled and able parliamentarian and campaigner who I believe would be an excellent choice for leader. In addition, his presence on the ballot as an anti-austerity candidate would give us as members a real choice in the future direction of the Labour party, whatever the final outcome.

Yours sincerely,

{{ name }}
