Dear {{ mp.full_name }},

I first wrote to you back in June in order to urge you to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership of the Labour Party, in order to ensure that the broadest range of views were available to be voted upon by the party membership.

Since then, I've been overwhelmed by the level of support that Jeremy's Campaign has received, and I'd like to thank you for your time in reading and considering that request, and for nominating Jeremy if you were one of the MPs to do so. Without your help, a significant proportion of the Labour grassroots would not have had the opportunity to have their voice heard in this important contest. Whatever the result of the ballot, we have had the opportunity to carry out the leadership campaign in a true spirit of democracy and inclusiveness, and of that we can be very proud.

However, I am distressed to note that a number of Labour MPs and public figures have, in anticipation of a victory for Mr Corbyn, begun actively briefing against him, questioning his legitimacy, and even threatening all-out revolt were he to gain the leadership. To do so is to deny the party membership the democratic right to choose a leader, directly contradicting the stated aims and values of the Labour Party.

I am therefore writing to you again in order to urge you to make a commitment to the unity of the party, regardless of the outcome of the ballot, and to urge your colleagues at Westminster to do the same.  Now more than ever, with the prospect of 5 more years of Tory government, it is crucial that we present a united front as a party, and all commit to playing our part, for the good of the party and the country.


Yours sincerely,

{{ name }}
